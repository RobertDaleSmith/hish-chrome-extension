hish.js
=======

JS widget for Medium's **hi**ghlight-and-**sh**are feature, supports Facebook and Twitter

## Example
[http://hishjs.pancakeapps.com/](http://hishjs.pancakeapps.com/)

## Usage
```js
$("#all-the-texts").hish();
```
Must provide an id selector. Class selectors won't work!

## Browser support
TBD (if it breaks on version X of browser Y, let me know! Seriously though, I wonder if there are tools out there to help with this...)

## Notes
* first JS library! \*__pops champagne__\*
* dependent on that cash $$$ JQuery but likely going to make it standalone in the near future
* also planning on adding sizing, animation, and styling options soon
* Twitter > Facebook because the Facebook Dialog API doesn't let me specify the text in the post :[
